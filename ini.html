        <p><b>Here is a quote from NAHSAG website:</b></p>
        <blockquote cite="https://nahsag.or">
        " The conversation around student health in Ghana overlooks a crucial aspect: mental health.
             For health students, the stakes are even higher, as they juggle academic rigors, clinical rotations and the emotional weight of care giving.‚Äù
              With this as their introduction, the research team of the National Health Students Association of Ghana released their findings yesterday, 17th March,
               2025 and from it, they pointed out key mental health issues facing Ghanaian Students ".

             challenge cultural stigma, promote mindfulness and
              resilience among others."</q>
